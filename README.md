# Simple MQTT Broker
This is an example of how to build an MQTT broker using Node.js and [aedes](https://github.com/mcollina/aedes/).

The code was tested using:

* Node.js v8.11.2
* npm 6.1.0


## Setup
In the repo directory, simply run
```
npm install
```


## Usage
You can start the broker using either:
```
npm start
```
or
```
node index.js
```

The broker will print out the messages it receives. Use Ctrl+C to exit.
